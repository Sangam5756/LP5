## âœ… **HPC Viva Questions (25)**

### ðŸ”¹ **General Parallel Programming & OpenMP (Q1â€“Q5)**

1. **What is parallel computing?**
   â†’ Executing multiple tasks at the same time using multiple cores or processors.

2. **What is OpenMP?**
   â†’ An API for writing parallel programs in C/C++ and Fortran for shared-memory systems.

   â†’ It creates multiple threads that execute the enclosed code block in parallel.

4. **What is a race condition?**
   â†’ When two threads access the same resource at the same time, causing unpredictable results.

5. **What is a critical section in OpenMP?**
   â†’ A block of code that only one thread can execute at a time to avoid race conditions.

### ðŸ”¹ **HPC 1: Parallel BFS and DFS (Q6â€“Q10)**

6. **What is BFS?**
   â†’ Breadth-First Search explores neighbors level-by-level using a queue.

7. **What is DFS?**
   â†’ Depth-First Search explores as far as possible down a path before backtracking using recursion or stack.

8. **How do you parallelize BFS in OpenMP?**
   â†’ By parallelizing the loop over each nodeâ€™s neighbors using `#pragma omp parallel for`.

9. **Why is DFS difficult to parallelize?**
   â†’ Because of recursion and shared visited array, which can lead to race conditions.

10. **Is BFS output always the same in parallel?**
    â†’ No, due to non-deterministic thread scheduling, the order may vary.

### ðŸ”¹ **HPC 2: Parallel Bubble and Merge Sort (Q11â€“Q15)**

11. **What is bubble sort?**
    â†’ A simple algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if theyâ€™re in the wrong order.

12. **How is bubble sort parallelized?**
    â†’ Using odd-even transposition, where non-conflicting elements are swapped in parallel.

13. **What is merge sort?**
    â†’ A divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively splits the array and merges sorted parts.

14. **How is merge sort parallelized using OpenMP?**
    â†’ Using `#pragma omp sections` to sort left and right halves in separate threads.

15. **Which is more efficient to parallelize: merge sort or bubble sort? Why?**
    â†’ Merge sort, because it naturally divides into independent subproblems.

### ðŸ”¹ **HPC 3: Parallel Reduction (Q16â€“Q20)**

16. **What is reduction in OpenMP?**
    â†’ Combining results from multiple threads into a single variable (e.g., sum, min, max).

17. **How do you find the average using reduction?**
    â†’ Sum all elements using `reduction(+:sum)` and divide by number of elements.

18. **Can you perform multiple reductions in the same loop?**
    â†’ Yes, e.g., `reduction(+:sum) reduction(min:minVal)`

19. **What are the limitations of parallel reduction?**
    â†’ It canâ€™t handle operations that are not associative or depend on ordering.

20. **What is the default scheduling in OpenMP loops?**
    â†’ Static, unless otherwise specified.

### ðŸ”¹ **HPC 4: CUDA Programming (Q21â€“Q25)**

21. **What is CUDA?**
    â†’ A parallel computing platform and API by NVIDIA for GPU programming.

22. **What are kernels in CUDA?**
    â†’ Functions that run on the GPU, executed by many threads in parallel.

23. **What is a thread block?**
    â†’ A group of threads that execute a CUDA kernel and share memory.

24. **What is the difference between host and device code?**
    â†’ Host code runs on CPU; device code (kernels) runs on GPU.

25. **Which applications benefit from GPU acceleration?**
    â†’ Matrix multiplication, vector operations, image processing, ML, etc.

## âœ… **Deep Learning Viva Questions (25)**

### ðŸ”¹ **DL1: Linear Regression with DNN (Q26â€“Q30)**

26. **What is regression in ML?**
    â†’ Predicting continuous values (e.g., price, temperature).

27. **What is the loss function used in linear regression?**
    â†’ Mean Squared Error (MSE).

28. **Why use DNN for linear regression?**
    â†’ To learn complex relationships if simple linearity is insufficient.

29. **Which activation function is used in output layer?**
    â†’ None or linear (since output is continuous).

30. **What metric is used to evaluate regression?**
    â†’ Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### ðŸ”¹ **DL2: Classification with DNN (OCR Dataset) (Q31â€“Q35)**

31. **What is multiclass classification?**
    â†’ Predicting one of several classes (e.g., letters A-Z).

32. **What is softmax activation used for?**
    â†’ Converts raw scores into probabilities in multiclass output.

33. **What is one-hot encoding?**
    â†’ A method to represent class labels as binary vectors.

34. **Which loss function is used for multiclass classification?**
    â†’ Categorical crossentropy.

35. **Why use label encoding + one-hot for OCR?**
    â†’ Neural nets need numeric + probability-friendly format.
